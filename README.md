# SR20-Climb-Performance
# Flight Analysis MATLAB Script  This repository contains a MATLAB script to analyze flight data including pressure altitude, true airspeed, rate of climb, and engine manifold pressure. The script also fits a quadratic curve to rate of climb vs airspeed to find optimal climb speeds Vy (best rate of climb) and Vx (best angle of climb).
